Assignments from my Data Structures, Algorithms, and Generic Programming 2 course

First assignment is a program that acts as a search engine that parses a list of all cities in the world with their respective countries and population number. The user gets to pick how many results they want to appear, then they input (n) a prefix of whatever city they want, then the top (n number) matches will appear based off the cities that match the prefix with the highest population.

Second assignment is a program that constructs a binary search tree using recursion. You will input a file into the program, then it will sort it from smallest to biggest and it states what the maximum and minimum is.
